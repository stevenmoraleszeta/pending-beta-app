# Firebase Configuration
# This file documents the required Firebase configuration for the application.
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is an Android project. Firebase configuration is done through
# the google-services.json file, not environment variables.
#
# To set up Firebase:
# 1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
# 3. Download the google-services.json file
# 4. Place it in the app/ directory (app/google-services.json)
#
# Firebase Services Required:
# - Firebase Authentication (Email/Password provider)
# - Cloud Firestore Database
#
# Firebase Security Rules:
# Set up Firestore security rules to allow authenticated users to access only their own data:
#
# rules_version = '2';
# service cloud.firestore {
#   match /databases/{database}/documents {
#     match /orders/{orderId} {
#       allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
#         resource.data.creator_mail == request.auth.token.email;
#     }
#     match /users/{userId} {
#       allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
#         request.auth.token.email == userId;
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# Build Configuration:
# All build configuration is managed through:
# - gradle.properties (project-wide settings)
# - app/build.gradle.kts (app-level settings)
# - build.gradle.kts (project-level settings)
#
# API Keys and Secrets:
# All API keys and configuration are managed through Firebase Console
# and the google-services.json file. Never commit production google-services.json
# files to public repositories.

# Development vs Production:
# For different environments (dev, staging, production), use different
# Firebase projects and corresponding google-services.json files.

# Example structure in google-services.json:
# {
#   "project_info": {
#     "project_number": "YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER",
#     "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
#     "storage_bucket": "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
#   },
#   "client": [
#     {
#       "client_info": {
#         "application_id": "com.innnova.pendingbetaapp"
#       },
#       ...
#     }
#   ]
# }
